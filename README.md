## u-ANN-from-scratch
Implementing a ANN (Artitficial Neural Network) from scratch using python

---

* this repository is for making a simple Neural Network from scratch without any libraries like Tensorflow or Pytorch

* it aims for using Titanic Dataset provided by kaggle

* it is from scratch which means all layers and derivatives are calculated manuly

* forward propagation and backprop is implemented manually
